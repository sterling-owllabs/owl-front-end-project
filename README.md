This project should take you no more than 2-3 hours (note that a few of these items are optional, if you are pressed for time). Please make commits after you complete small-sized chunks of work. We want to see how you work the exericse through your commit diffs. We do not want to see big commits.

1. Fork this repo and work from your fork
2. Before you start working, make a simple commit that acts as a timestamp to begin your 2-3 hour windows.
3. Using only HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks, libraries, etc.), and the open API from NASA for Mars Rover Photos (available [here](https://api.nasa.gov/)), create a simple application that displays a list of photos returned from the API (NASA has a `DEMO_KEY` available, so you shouldn't need to sign up for a key) 
4. Add a button to sort the photos by date taken.
5. `(Optional)` Add a button that lets you re-fetch the latest photos without reloading the page.
6. `(Optional)` Jazz it up however you see fit.
7. Submit a PR to this repo.
